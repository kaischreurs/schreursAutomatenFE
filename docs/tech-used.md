# Tech used

We will be using [Lit](https://lit.dev/docs/) with typescript because it is what I am most familiar with. We use the [vaadin router](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/hilla/lit/guides/routing), when looking for documentation on this make sure you are looking at the front-end router as vaadin also has tools for a java back-end.

Any other relevant things like this will be added to this file when added to the project.
